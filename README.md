### Overview

SMCalloutView aims to be an exact replica of the private UICalloutView system control. **It's not finished yet!**

We all love those "bubbles" you get when clicking pins in MKMapView. But sadly, it's impossible to present this bubble-style "Callout" UI anywhere outside MKMapView. Bummer! So this class _painstakingly_ recreates this handy control for your pleasure.

### ARC Support

This class requires [Automatic Reference Counting (ARC)](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.html), enabled by default in modern Xcode projects.
